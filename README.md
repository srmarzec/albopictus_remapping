# Aedes albopictus RNAseq remapping
Multiple projects and publications have been completed and generated understanding expression difference of diapause and non-diapause at multiple timepoints during the *Aedes albopictus* lifecycle. However, now a better quality reference assembly exists and old data needs to be reanalyzed based on this reference. We will re-analyze the various diapause transcriptomes. Potentially, once all analyses are done against common reference, we may also look for clusters of genes that change across timepoints in a coordinated way (look into [Kostal et al 2017](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/8532) and [Dowle et al 2020](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/38/23960)).

  As this is a collaborative effort, but must be done consistently across different sample timepoints, several sets of notes are on record. Please refer to the [master notes](https://github.com/srmarzec/albopictus_remapping/blob/main/misc/MasterNotes.md) as the main workflow process.
